Tools like Warden, Borg at Google, Solaris Containers, and Cloud Foundry, leverage new concepts for application isolation.</p><p>Lastly, the groundbreaking introduction of usernamespace into the Linux kernel in 2013, marked the inception of Docker. This influential tool simplifies container creation and management based on Linux kernel functionalities. Through these advancements, a new era in application deployment was ushered in, transforming the landscape of computing.</p><h3 id="software-stack-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#software-stack-architecture" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Software stack architecture</h3>',44),O=e("img",{src:f,alt:"architecture"},null,-1),C={href:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gounthar/learning-2024-devops/main/docs/src/assets/images/iaas-paas-saas-on-premise.png",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},E=r('<h4 id="layers-of-a-software-stack" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#layers-of-a-software-stack" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Layers of a Software Stack:</h4><p><code>Application Layer</code>: User-facing applications like web browsers, business software.</p><p><code>Data Layer</code>: Manages and stores data: databases, data lakes, file storage systems.</p><p><code>Runtime Layer</code>: Environment for executing software: Java Runtime Environment, .NET Framework.</p><p><code>Middleware Laye</code>r`: Intermediary layer: web servers, application servers, message brokers, APIs.</p><p><code>Operating System Laye</code>r: Manages hardware resources: Windows, Linux, macOS.</p><p><code>Virtualization Layer</code>: Abstracts hardware: virtual machines (VMs), containers.</p><p><code>Servers Layer</code>: Provides computational resources: application servers, database servers.</p><p><code>Storage Layer</code>: Manages data storage: block storage, object storage, databases.</p><p><code>Networking Layer</code>: Handles communication: LANs, WANs, routers, switches, TCP/IP.</p><h4 id="service-models" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#service-models" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Service models</h4><p><strong>On-Premises:</strong> This refers to the traditional method of hosting and managing computing resources within an organization&#39;s physical location or data center.

It typically includes tools for building, testing, and deploying applications. PaaS offers a framework that simplifies the development process, enabling developers to focus on coding rather than managing hardware or software updates.</p><p><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. It allows users to access and use software hosted in the cloud without needing to install or maintain it on their devices.
