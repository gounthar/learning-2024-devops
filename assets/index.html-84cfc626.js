These services are typically organized around business domains, enabling flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance compared to monolithic architectures.</p><h2 id="api-gateways" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#api-gateways" aria-hidden="true">#</a> API Gateways</h2><p>API Gateways serve as the entry point for client requests in a microservices architecture. They manage and route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices, providing a single point of entry for clients and handling tasks such as authentication, authorization, and load balancing.</p><p>This section introduces the concept of Microservices, emphasizing their architectural approach based on decentralized, independent services. It highlights the advantages of this approach in terms of flexibility and scalability, along with the role of API Gateways in managing communication between microservices.</p><h2 id="exercises" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exercises" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Exercises</h2><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="arch1"><img src="'+e+'" alt="arch2"></p>',10),n=[c];function o(h,d){return i(),s("div",null,n)}const p=a(r,[["render",o],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
